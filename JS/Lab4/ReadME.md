# Weather Data Analysis

This project provides a simple web application to display weather data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. It analyzes and displays various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, wind direction, and rain probability.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Ensure you have obtained an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and replace `'YOUR-API-HERE'` with your API key in the `script.js` file.

3. Replace `'YOUR-CITY-NAME'` in the `script.js` file with the name of the city for which you want to fetch weather data.

4. Customize the styles in the `styles.css` file to match your preferences.

5. Run a local server if needed to view the application in the browser due to security restrictions when loading local files.
