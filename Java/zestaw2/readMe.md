# Mathematical Project

## Description

The Mathematical Project is a set of Java classes that implement various mathematical objects and operations. The project includes classes representing complex numbers, fractions, vectors in three-dimensional space, and quadratic polynomials. Each class contains methods for basic mathematical operations related to the respective object.

## Classes

### 1. ComplexNumber

The `ComplexNumber` class represents a complex number. It provides methods for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers, as well as access to their real and imaginary parts.

### 2. Fraction

The `Fraction` class represents a fraction. It includes methods for performing mathematical operations on fractions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, inversion, simplification, and calculation of the decimal value.

### 3. Vector

The `Vector` class represents a vector in three-dimensional space. It provides methods for addition, subtraction, calculating the dot product, calculating the cross product, and calculating the length of the vector.

### 4. QuadraticPolynomial

The `QuadraticPolynomial` class represents a quadratic polynomial of the form ax^2 + bx + c. It includes methods for addition, multiplication, and finding the roots of such polynomials.

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone the project to your development environment.
2. Open the `Main` class and see examples of using different mathematical object classes.
3. Run the program to see the results of operations on fractions, complex numbers, vectors, and quadratic polynomials.

## Additional Notes

- The project is created in Java.
- Each class has appropriate methods for performing basic mathematical operations.
- Remember to handle errors properly, such as division by zero or inversion of a fraction with a zero numerator.
- For quadratic polynomials, the program calculates the roots, considering various cases (two real roots, one real root, no real roots).
- Use the `toString()` methods for convenient display of results.
